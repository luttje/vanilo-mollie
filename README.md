# Mollie Payment Gateway Support for Vanilo

[![MIT Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

This library will provide integration for [Mollie](https://docs.mollie.com/index) in [Vanilo Payments](https://vanilo.io/docs/master/payments).

This library is a [Concord Module](https://konekt.dev/concord/1.9/modules) and intended for use with Laravel.


## Documentation

Refer to the markdown files in the [docs](docs/) folder.


## ⚠ WIP

This library is a minimal starting point for getting Mollie working with the [Vanilo](https://vanilo.io) [Payments Package](https://vanilo.io/docs/master/payments).

I intend to work on it further in the future, but for now it is untested and unstable. For that reason I will not publish it to composer.

If you do wish to use this in a project, you'll have to [require this library as a local package](https://mauricius.dev/require-a-local-composer-package-for-development/). **Use it at your own risk.**
